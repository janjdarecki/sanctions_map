Each country continuing to finance the Russian regime through imports of gas or any other goods or resources is complicit in the death of Ukrainians.

												&lt;a href="">European Union&lt;/a>
					&lt;p>Along with the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, the European Union has been the driving force in sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The most recent, and most potent, measures include a ban on transactions with the Russian central bank.&lt;/p>&lt;p>On Saturday, February 26, the European Commission, in concordance with the U.S, Canada and the U.K, announced a plan to cut off select Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system.&lt;/p>&lt;p>On Tuesday, March 1, Bloomberg reported that European Union ambassadors reached an agreement to exclude 7 Russian banks from SWIFT. The nation’s biggest lender Sberbank PJSC and a bank partially owned by Russian gas giant Gazprom PJSC have been spared, however. The measure is said to come into force 10 days after its adoption.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Along with its newest set of sanctions, announced on 28 February, the EU has pledged €500 million to finance equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces and also enforced an EU-wide airspace ban for all Russian carriers.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Prior measures include the adoption of personal sanctions, export control and wide-ranging restrictions on the financial, energy and transport sectors.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Most recently, the country, along with other EU members, has imposed a ban on imports of coal, wood, cement, liquor and seafood from Russia; introduced trade restrictions for iron, steel and luxury goods; prohibited investment in the Russian energy sector; blocked Russian vessels from entering EU ports and banned the export of jet fuel, among other goods.&lt;/p>&lt;p>A full timeline of EU sanctions can be found on: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/restrictive-measures-against-russia-over-ukraine/history-restrictive-measures-against-russia-over-ukraine/&lt;/p>&lt;p>Other sources: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/restrictive-measures-ukraine-crisis/history-ukraine-crisis/&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/26/joint-statement-on-further-restrictive-economic-measures/&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-01/eu-agrees-to-block-russian-banks-from-swift-sparing-key-firm&lt;/p>

					&lt;p>The United States, along with its western allies, has been the driving force in sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Export controls on American technology, dual-use goods and military-related equipment, as well as tight financial controls, personal sanctions and a ban on specific SWIFT payments have been imposed to cripple the Russian economy.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The U.S has excluded all major Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, including the Russian central bank.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Most recently, a bipartisan bill meant to ban Russian imports of oil has been introduced in the American Congress. On March 8, it was confirmed that the U.S will ban Russian oil, as well as other energy imports.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Sources: https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/ukraine-russia-related-sanctions&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/congress-russian-oil-imports-ban/index.html&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/byvrjenzmve/&lt;/p>

					&lt;p>On February 28, South Korea&amp;#8217;s Foreign Ministry announced that it will actively participate in international sanctions against Russia. Measures include bans on SWIFT payments with several commercial Russian banks, the tightening of export and financial controls and personal sanctions.&lt;/p>&lt;p>In its statement, the Ministry also said the Korean government has decided to promote the additional release of strategic oil reserves for stabilisation of the international energy market, and to further review other measures such as the resale of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe.

					&lt;p>On February 23, on the day the EU imposed sanctions relating to the Russian recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Albania Minister of Foreign Affairs Olta Xhacka said that Albania will join the sanctions and that the country is fully aligned with EU foreign policy.&lt;/p>&lt;p>On February 28, the Foreign Ministry unveiled sanctions against Russia, which include trade restrictions in finance, energy, transport and technology. Personal sanctions, including the freezing of assets of 654 individuals, including President of Russia Vladimir Putin have also been introduced.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Additional measures include the closure of airspace to Russian aircraft.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Albania is yet to publicly confirm its participation in the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, as well as in the EU&amp;#8217;s fourth and fifth package of sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Sources: https://www.gazetatema.net/en/albania-aligns-itself-with-eu-sanctions-against-russia-says-minister/&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://balkaninsight.com/2022/02/28/albania-unveils-sanctions-on-russia-over-attack-on-ukraine/&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/albania-closes-its-airspace-russian-airlines-2022-02-27&lt;/p>
												&lt;a href="">Australia&lt;/a>
					&lt;p>In a media statement released on February 28, the government of Australia outlined the sanctions currently in place against Russia. The government also committed to the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system, as well as an end to the 'golden passport&amp;#8217; scheme for Russians tied to the Kremlin. However, according to Reuters, Australia is not one of the countries that blocked Russian banks from SWIFT.  &lt;/p>&lt;p>On March 1, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison pledged $30 million in humanitarian aid and $75 million in lethal and non-lethal defence aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Most recently, the country has banned exports of aluminum, as well as transactions with several Russian state-owned enterprises.

												&lt;a href="">Canada&lt;/a>
					&lt;p>Through the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations act, the Canadian government has imposed personal sanctions on a number of Russian entities and persons, as well as prohibiting the export of certain goods and technologies to Russia.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Canada has also banned Russian aircraft from accessing its airspace and Russian ships and vessels from entering its ports and waters.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Despite not banning Russian banks (commercial or state) from the SWIFT messaging system, on February 28, the Canadian government introduced a ban on crude oil from Russia. However, the ban remains largely symbolic as the country has not imported Russian crude oil since 2019 when the Russian resource made up less than 2% of imports.&lt;/p>&lt;p>In addition to the sanctions on Russia, Canada has approved an additional package of $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Sources: https://www.reuters.com/world/canada-foreign-minister-says-more-sanctions-coming-against-russia-2022-02-28/&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/icc-joly-russia-war-crimes-1.6368272&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/byvrjenzmve/&lt;/p>&lt;p>https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/finish-the-symbolic-move-go-all-the-way-canadas-ban-on-russian-crude-oil-could-be-expanded&lt;/p>

Currently, New Zealand&amp;#8217;s laws do not enable the introduction of wider-ranging sanctions.&lt;/p>&lt;p>On March 7, New Zealand&amp;#8217;s government introduced legislation to enabling the country to levy personal sanctions on Russian individuals and entities.
